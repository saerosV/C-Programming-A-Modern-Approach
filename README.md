# C-Programming-A-Modern-Approach
My solutions to exercises and projects found on the textbook "C Programming - A Modern Approach (2nd edition)", by K. N. King.

Currently going through the book, solutions will be added as soon as completed. Refactoring of past projects is to be expected, according to newly acquired knowledge of the C programming language. 


Status: ON HOLD untill completing the Core Programming Module from OSSU:
